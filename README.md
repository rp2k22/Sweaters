# Sweaters
This is it! This is the first incarnation of my big program that generates machine knit sweater patterns from human body measurements!

## Things to come
  What all the funky symbols mean  
  How the puzzle fits together  
  A blog post I bet (thewood-pile.com)   

## Changes I need to make
  Some really good commenting action  
  Make it easier to input data  
  I might move the whole thing into a Colab notebook for ease of use?
